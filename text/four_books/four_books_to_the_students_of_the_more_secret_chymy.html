                                conducing to Mankind, and more narrowly searching into the most
                                profound Secrets of Nature, than is our true and more than laudable
                                        <em class="ph i">Chymy</em>. This is it which shews the Clemency, Wisdom,
                                and Omnipotence of the Creator in the Creatures, which teacheth not
                                only Speculation, but also Practice and Demonstration, the
                                Beginning, Progress, and end of things, which restoreth our Bodies
                                from infinite Diseases, as by common means intolerable to pristine
                                health, and diverts our Minds from the Cares and Anxieties of the
                                World (the Thorns and Bryars of our Souls) to Tranquility of Life,
                                from Pride to Humility, from the Love and Desire of worldly Wealth
                                to the Contempt thereof: And in a word, with raiseth us from earth
                                to heaven; Yet for all that may we say of it with the same truth,
                                that amongst all the Arts, which have yielded any benefit or profit
                                to the World, there is none, by which less honour has hitherto
                                accrued to God Almighty, and less utility to mankind; for lest a
                                Science of so great dignity and utility should be too common, or ill
                                managed by the ignorant and impious, the prudent Possessors of the
                                same made it their business so to describe it, as to make it known
                                to their Disciples only, but exclude unworthy altogether from it:
                                But in process of time, the <em class="ph i">Adepts</em> arriving to a greater
                                perfection of Knowledge and Experience, invented sometimes one,
                                sometimes another shorter Method in their Work, altering Fornaces,
                                Fires, Vessels, Weights, yea, and the Matter it self; who being
                                thereby also constrain’d to make new Theories and Terms of Art,
                                according to the new invented Practice, it happened, that the
                                Scholar of one <em class="ph i">Adept</em> understood not the new Theory, much less
                                the practice of another; which also sometimes happened to the
                                        <em class="ph i">Adepts</em> themselves, those especially which were under
                                the document of some certain Patron in some particular Method and
                                Process; for they had not the power of discerning further than they
                                had learnt; whereupon they commonly suspected all the Notions of
                                other men, especially those that differed from theirs, though in
                                themselves good and right, as fallacious and contrary to Nature, or
                                applied other mens Theories, Sentences, and Terms of Art unknown to
                                themselves to their own private Process, with which they were
                                acquainted, as I shall by many Examples elsewhere declare; by which
                                very thing they involved this Art in such a Chaos of obscurity, that
                                hitherto neither Masters nor Scholars have scarce had the power of
                                communicating any benefit to the learned World. It is to be wondred
                                at, but rather lamented, to see such imperfect Philosophical
                                Systems, as have been hitherto bequeathed to us by the Masters of
                                this Art, not seldom contradicting both Nature and themselves,
                                whereas the Miracles of Nature might by virtue of this Art have been
                                truly and plainly without any convulsion or contraction of words
                                expressed, in which respect I dare, with Philosophical Licence here
                                affirm, that most of the <em class="ph i">Adepts</em> have by their Writings
                                declared themselves to the World better <em class="ph i">Chymists</em> than
                                        <em class="ph i">Philosophers</em>. For what I pray could they have better
                                done in Medicine, than to have applied themselves to this Subject,
                                imitating the diligence and industry of <em class="ph i">Paracelsus</em>? But alas!
                                amongst all, I find perhaps three or four, who have been careful and
                                cordial herein; and therefore the less to be admired, that this
                                noble and necessary Art, has made no greater progress, witness
                                Common Chymistry, where the names of famous Medicines are noised
                                about, themselves being unknown, and Shells given for Kernels.
                                Lately indeed we had not only hope, but promises also from the
                                Rosy-Crucian Fraternity, as if they had a mind to make this our Age
                                more happy by their Studies; but no effect being hitherto heard of,
                                we cannot but fear, their fair promises will never be performed.</p>

                        <p class="p">On the contrary, Experience teacheth, that instead of an universal good
                                derived from the Fountain of this Art, the World hath rather been
                                involved by it in great and many Miseries: for the <em class="ph i">Adepts</em>
                                affirming, yea more than often with oaths confirming, that they in
                                their Writings treated more clearly and truly of the Art, than any
                                other Philosophers, have thereby instigated many young Novices of
                                all Degrees and Faculties, to begin their Chymical Labours according
                                to the Method of their Prescriptions, exposing themselves not only
                                to intolerable Expences, but also being as it were obstinate in a
                                certain confidence of their understanding the Authors genuine
                                meaning, do rather die amongst the Coals and Fornaces, than recede
                                from their Imaginations, once imprinted in them for true: Whereupon
                                some of the more Learned Inquirers ruminating with themselves, how
                                rarely, and with what great difficulty some of the <em class="ph i">Adepts</em>
                                attained to the Art by the reading of Books only, thought it a point
                                of Prudence to desert the Authors, together with their Books,
                                perswading themselves to be able to find out a nearer and easier way
                                by virtue of their own Genius and Reason, trying, repeating,
                                altering, etc. Experiments and Conclusions, but herein were they
                                disappointed of their desired success, no less than as a Mariner
                                fayling without a Compass, and so such Inquirers would have acted
                                more advisedly, if they had inquired in themselves, whether they had
                                overcome all the Difficulties obvious to them, before they applied
                                themselves to this more secret Art, and doubtless many of them would
                                have hearkened to the Counsel of <em class="ph i">Theobald</em> of <em class="ph i">Hohenland</em>
                                (who copiously described the Difficulties of this Art collected out
                                of Philosophers Books) and avoided it, as worse than the Plague, or
                                a Serpent: <em class="ph i">For who of you </em>(saith our Saviour) <em class="ph i">intending to
                                        build a Tower, will not first sit down, and compute the
                                        Charge, whether he has wherewith to finish it, lest having
                                        laid the Foundation, and not being able to perfect it, all
                                        that beheld it, should begin to deride him, saying, That man
                                        began to build, and could not finish the Building</em>, Luke
                                14. 38. But I am sensible that these Admonitions will rather be
                                slighted than accepted, especially by those who are loath to have
                                the magnificent Towers built by themselves in the Air, demolished.
                                For notwithstanding the impossibility of removing the aforesaid
                                difficulties by some men, they endeavour to persuade others, that
                                they can teach them, what as yet they know not themselves, and so
                                will rather persist in deceiving, than desist from that which they
                                know to be Weakness and Error: Others think themselves very able to
                                overcome all manner of difficulties, and therefore it is in vain to
                                dissuade them from this Art: Others indeed perceiving all the
                                difficulties, and an undoubted incapacity in themselves of
                                facilitating them, are though free from all fraud and arrogance, yet
                                by some natural or secret impulse so incited to this Art, as not to
                                be driven from it by any Argument.</p>

                        <p class="p">Wherefore having a sense of the frailty which mankind is afflicted with,
                                to them will I dedicate my Studies relating to Medicine. Deceivers I
                                will restrain, shame those that ascribe more to themselves than due;
                                but the true Disciples of this Art, I will lead by the hand, that
                                they may not for the future be subject to the derision, reproaches
                                and scoffs of Satyrs, together with the loss of health, as well of
                                Mind as Body, and at length verifie in themselves the lamentable
                                Prediction of <em class="ph i">Geber</em>, saying, <em class="ph i">Most miserable and unhappy is
                                        he, whom, after the end of his work, God denies to see the
                                        Truth, for he ends his Life in Error; who being constituted
                                        in perpetual labour, and surrounded with all manner of
                                        Misfortune and Infelicity, loseth all the Comfort and Joy of
                                        this World, and spends his Life in Sorrow, without any
                                        benefit or reward, </em>Lib. 2. Invest cap. 38. So with the
                                same Argument will I vindicate this the best of Arts from the
                                Injuries of Defamers, who being deceived, by not knowing the
                                Principles, accuse it as fraudulent, impossible, and so ridiculous,
                                as that they deter the Lovers of it, and incite them to vilifie all
                                the demonstrations and famous Testimonies of the same, and lastly
                                That the Honour and Glory of God hitherto buried in the Ashes of it,
                                may from thence rise again, as a Phœnix, I will set before your
                                eyes, that which you have not been hitherto able to find in so many
                                Volumes of this Art, namely, <em class="ph i">Diana</em> naked, or without Cloaths;
                                that is, I will take from her Face and Body, the Vizards of Tropes,
                                Figures, Parables, barbarous Names, etc. by which she hath been
                                hitherto disguised, lest she should be obvious to the knowledge of
                                wicked men. I will expose <em class="ph i">Diana</em> to you, namely, the
                                        <em class="ph i">very</em>
         <em class="ph i">Truth</em> of our Art. (with so much study and
                                labour sought in vain) not covered indeed so much as with the Veyl
                                of necessary expression, but her most secret parts shall be exposed
                                to your view concerning which the <em class="ph i">Adepts</em> gave exceeding
                                caution to the Disciples, adding a Curse withal, not to divulge them
                                to the unworthy Rabble. Wherefore if you desire to know the
                                        <em class="ph i">Menstruums</em> of <em class="ph i">Diana</em>, wherewith the
                                        <em class="ph i">Adepts</em> prepared their Philters, the Liquors of Life
                                and Death, if you would know the way how they prepared their
                                Tinctures, either universal or particular for Metals; if lastly, you
                                covet to know how they made precious Stones, Pearls, perpetual
                                Lights, together with other Secrets of the Art, read the Receipts of
                                the four Books following; Receipts I say, which were either not
                                understood, or altogether slighted by almost all of you, because of
                                the ruggedness of their Style, which sometimes also you esteemed
                                vain, false, and impossible, compiled in a manner merely to deceive
                                you, yet most true, collected not out of trivial vulgar Chymistry,
                                but out of the best Books of the best <em class="ph i">Adepts</em>, the Treasury of
                                        <em class="ph i">Diana</em>; Receipts, I say, so concatenated and
                                elaborated by as well the congruity, as wonderful dexterity of the
                                Masters, that where you take away or deny one of them, you cannot
                                but reject all the rest as false: on the contrary, he that owns one
                                amongst all to be true, must repute all the rest true; and
                                consequently vindicate the Authors of them, our most venerable
                                Masters from all the Infamy of Lying and Scurrility. Variety
                                springing out of Unity, the Fountain of Truth, and returning into
                                it, as into its Ocean, illustrates the excellency of those Receipts.
                                I could never yet satisfie my self, whether there by infinite, or
                                only one Receipt in our Chymy, divided into divers parts, and
                                designed for several Uses: Variety I observe in the various and
                                distinct parts of these four Treatises, but Unity in every part, yea
                                in the Individual of every Part, you will always find three
                                confirming one Treatise: In the First Book of <em class="ph i">Menstruums</em>, you
                                will find also the Medicines of the Second; and Alchymical Tinctures
                                of the Third, and Secrets of the Fourth Book, which very thing is
                                also to be understood of the Second, Third and Fourth Books. Lastly
                                These Receipts are not only true, but also clear, described by plain
                                and common Words, to be understood not only according to the Letter,
                                but also by their clearness, illustrating and explaining Places more
                                obscure otherwise not intelligible, so that by one only Process you
                                will sometimes explain more than ten Theoretical Books, never
                                explicable but by this Light. Now these Receipts I was willing to
                                communicate to you, ye <em class="ph i">indefatigable Students</em> of this Art,
                                for the Reasons already given, as also that you may thoroughly
                                apprehend the <em class="ph i">absolute necessity</em> of <em class="ph i">Lully’s Spirit</em> of
                                        <em class="ph i">Wine</em> in our <em class="ph i">Chymy</em>, before I treat with you
                                concerning the <em class="ph i">Matter</em> and <em class="ph i">Preparation</em> of it. No man
                                desires that which is unknown to him, or pursues that which he knows
                                not the benefit of: Wherefore I was desirous first to demonstrate
                                the <em class="ph i">several Uses</em> of this Spirit by the Experiments of the
                                        <em class="ph i">Adepts</em>, which if you find true, they will be of such
                                service to you hereafter, as to be much to your detriment to be
                                without them; but if false, slight and give no credit to them, but
                                accuse the Masters, the Authors of them, of Lying, Deceit and
                                Villany; but such wickedness I never expect from you, whatsoever
                                Adversaries, the blind and ignorant of this Art, will do, we little
                                regard, and if a <em class="ph i">Zoilus</em> or <em class="ph i">Momus</em> appear according to
                                his Custom, let him chaw the Shell, that is, the homely Style, the
                                slender and slight Observations and Conclusions given upon the
                                Receipts, all which we give him freely; but touch the <em class="ph i">Kernel</em>
                                he cannot.</p>

                        <p class="p">But if either now or hereafter you reap any joy or benefit by the sight
                                of <em class="ph i">Diana</em>, attribute it not to <em class="ph i">Diana</em>, though of
                                        <em class="ph i">Ephesus</em>, nor to me, but to God Almighty, who hath by
                                his Light brought us out of this <em class="ph i">Cimmerian</em> Darkness. The time
                                perhaps will come, wherein I may be further useful and assistant, in
                                procuring liberty for you to embrace <em class="ph i">Diana</em> in your Arms, as
                                also discourse familiarly with her concerning her <em class="ph i">Doves, Forest,

                                advise you, not to touch the Secrets of <em class="ph i">Diana</em> unless you have

                                to be made between the Theoretical and Practical Books of the
                                        <em class="ph i">Adepts</em>: In the Theoretical Books there is scarce any
                                thing to be understood literally, all things being parabolical,
                                ænigmatical, etc. But in the Practical Books all things are clear
                                and intelligible, according to the Letter: <em class="ph i">Philosophical Wine</em>
                                alone excepted, the foundation and beginning of all Secrets: For
                                example, Take the <em class="ph i">magnum Testamentum </em>of <em class="ph i">Lully</em>, in the
                                Theoretical part of which, is Philosophically, that is, by various

                                </em>of <em class="ph i">Lully’s Wine</em>; but in the Practical part of this
                                        <em class="ph i">Testamentum</em>, the <em class="ph i">Use</em> of this <em class="ph i">Wine</em> is
                                declared according to the Letter: From hence will you also easily
                                observe, That those <em class="ph i">Adepts</em> which reject the Literal Sense are
                                rather Theoretical than Practical. We treating at present of the

                                that the <em class="ph i">Adepts</em> themselves have even more than often declamed

                                        before I went away, I had gathered a very large Book of such

                                        some contained Projections of One upon Ten, others upon

                                        Carrachs, twenty, etc. into Gold of Crowns, Ducats, and of
                                        the highest colour that could be; One was to endure Melting,
                                        another the Touch-stone, another all Tryals: Of the White
                                        likewise, one was to be of Ten penny, another of Eleven,
                                        another Sterling Silver, coming white out of the Fire,
                                        another white from the Touch: In short, I thought if I were

                                        could not happen to me in this world. Especially when I read
                                        the Inscriptions of great Persons before such Receipts; one

                                Summa, <em class="ph i">and other Seducers, I will first declare my own
                                Errors</em>, etc. And in pag. 750 goes on, <em class="ph i">Infinite is the number
                                        of them, whom to write is needless; and there is great
                                        plenty of Books written upon this Subject under Metaphorical
                                        Words and Figures, so as not to be easily understood by any
                                        but the Sons of Art; the reading of which, leads men out of
                                        the right way, rather than directs to the Work; in the
                                        number of which, are</em> Scotus, Arnold, Raymund, Johannes
                                Mehung, Hortulanus Veridicus, etc. My Business therefore is to
                                satisfie you, and say, That the Authors of the first sort of
                                Receipts deceive actively, wittingly, and willingly: But the
                                Receipts of the later sort, written by <em class="ph i">Adepts</em> themselves,
                                seduce only passively: And this for two Reasons; either in respect
                                of the <em class="ph i">Adept</em> being less experienced in the Art, and
                                unacquainted with the Practice of his more Learned Consort; for it
                                is impossible for one <em class="ph i">Adept</em>, though never so expert in his
                                Method, to know the various Experiments of all the other, much less
                                the peculiar Theorems, private Meditations, different Denominations
                                of things, etc. formed or derived from the same. Or in respect of
                                your selves, who extort from those Receipts, as to the Literal
                                Sound, more than the <em class="ph i">Adepts</em> themselves allow, not at all
                                observing that the <em class="ph i">Spirit of Wine</em> being once and always
                                understood, the rest you will easily understand. <em class="ph i">For knowing
                                        this, </em>saith <em class="ph i">Flammel, in his Hieroglyphicks</em>, pag.
                                28. <em class="ph i">I perfected the Magistery easily; for having learnt the
                                        Preparation of the first Agent, I following my Book
                                        according to the Letter, could not err if I would</em>. And a
                                little after; <em class="ph i">Then following my Book from word to word, I made
                                        Projection</em>. But why these? Plenty enough of Examples in
                                this Treatise will instruct you in all these things that are to be
                                understood according to the Letter, except <em class="ph i">Wine, Lunary,
                                        Vegetable Mercury</em>, and other things synonymous to the
                                Matter of the <em class="ph i">Spirit of Philosophical Wine</em>, or things
                                prepared by the same Spirit, <em class="ph i">Vegetable Sal Harmoniack,
                                        Philosophical Vinegar</em>, etc.</p>

                        <p class="p">For this <em class="ph i">Spirit </em>of <em class="ph i">Wine</em> being prevaricated, the
                                        <em class="ph i">Adepts</em> knew, that all the rest, though never so
                                plainly discovered to the Sons of Art, could not contribute the
                                least benefit to the Reader: Wherefore I fear not the indignation of
                                the <em class="ph i">Adepts</em>, nor the Anathema’s which they thundred out
                                against the Betrayers of their Secrets, having herein done nothing
                                more, but (to speak ingenuously) less, than they themselves. I have
                                according to my capacity, methodically digested those things which
                                were here and there confusedly dispersed, but added nothing of my
                                own, and so expect neither Honour nor Thanks from you; but this
                                only, that I may know, if our Studies please; and I shall supply
                                those things that are here wanting and desired, somewhat more
                                largely; for I will not refuse to assist you yet further by the
                                industry of my Studies: So that nothing remains, but upon our bended
                                Knees to return most humble Thanks to the <em class="ph i">Father </em>of
                                        <em class="ph i">Lights</em>, in vouchsafing us this Art by the Writings of
                                his Servants, and the High Priests of Nature, without which it would
                                be beyond the power of man to arrive to so great a degree of
                                Knowledge. Now celebrate with me the Urns of our pious Masters, who
                                have for the Welfare of Mankind, rather dispersed, than buried their
                                Talents; and may you oblige your selves to the same good Office, if
                                you have any of their Writings not yet published. Finally, It is my
                                earnest Suit to the <em class="ph i">Adepts</em> now living, that they would please
                                to employ themselves freely in expounding Nature, correcting
                                Philosophy and Medicine; And lastly, refuting all the deceitful
                                Sects of Philosophers, as well in the Academies, as private Schools,
                                for the advancement of the Glory of God, being singularly eminent in
                                this Art. <em class="ph i">So be it</em>.</p>
